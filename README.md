# ThumbIt Backend

ThumbIt Backend is a secure and high-performance REST API built with Spring Boot to support the ThumbIt mobile application. The backend enables fingerprint-based money transfers, eliminating the need for mobile numbers, bank accounts, or credit cards. It handles user authentication, transaction management, and security, ensuring fast and reliable operations.

The API exposes endpoints for user registration, biometric authentication, fund transfers, transaction history, and balance management. All sensitive operations are secured using modern encryption and authentication standards, making the system safe and fraud-resistant.

Built with scalability in mind, the backend uses PostgreSQL for persistent storage and integrates seamlessly with the React Native frontend. It is designed to handle concurrent requests efficiently and provides clear, structured JSON responses for client applications.

This project demonstrates Spring Boot development, REST API design, database integration, and security best practices, providing a robust foundation for a next-generation biometric payment solution.
